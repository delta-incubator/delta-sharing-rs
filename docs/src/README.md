# Introduction

[Delta Sharing](https://delta.io/sharing/) is an open protocol for secure sharing of large datasets.
The protocol enables sharing of data in realtime independent of the computing platform that is used
to read the datasets. At the heart of the Delta Sharing is the
[REST protocol](https://github.com/delta-io/delta-sharing/blob/main/PROTOCOL.md) that defines the API
that can be used by clients to obtain in-place access to shared datasets.
