DevOps Files
==============================

 This directory contains several IaC code snippets that are used for development and deployment purposes.
The most relevant codes for users are included in the [docker](docker) directory, which contains `Dockerfile`
and `docker-compose.yaml` files. These files are not intended for individual deployment purposes, but they
will give you a hint on how to create your own deployment files.
